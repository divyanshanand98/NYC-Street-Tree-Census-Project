## NYC Street Tree Census Project
This project is created to analyze New York City Tree Census data to find insights and anomalies, detect patterns and uncover any gaps during the process. The 2015 Street Tree Census was carried out by volunteers and staff organized by NYC Parks & Recreation and partner organizations. The tree data collected includes information on tree species, diameter, perception of health, location etc.

## The Dataset

The dataset used for this project is the 2015 NYC Street Tree Census - Tree Data provided by Department of Parks and Recreation (DPR). 

This dataset has nearly 684K rows, 45 columns and each row is a tree. It was sourced from the NYC Open Data website.

## Problem Statement

- Break down the population of trees by status and health.
- What is the extent of tree cover in the streets of NYC?
- Evaluate the time and effort invested in the census.
- Summarize different characteristics of the trees surveyed.
- Are there any outliers in the tree diameter measurements? If yes, use an effective way to handle them and provide the average and median diameter of different tree populations: alive, dead and stumps.
- Are there any correlations between various characteristics of the trees?
- Are trees causing any harm or damage to their immediate surroundings? If yes, is it excessive?
- Explore the spread of different types of tree guards across NYC Boroughs and NTAs.
- What are the major problems affecting trees in NYC and their scale?
- Provide an overview of the outlier trees, if any, and efficient ways to address these outliers.

## Skills Demonstrated

- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Geopandas

## The Data Analysis Process

1. Loading the Data
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

## Conclusion

We analyzed the NYC Street Tree Census Open Dataset to provide data-driven answers to all the questions. We first explored, cleaned and transformed the dataset, handled outliers and subsequently analyzed and visualized the data. Eventually, we uncovered various facts, insights, patterns and correlations and recommended a method to address the outlier trees efficiently.
